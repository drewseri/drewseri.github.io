<p>
Since 2011, I have been a student programmer for the Residential and Hospitality Services (RHS) 
division here at Michigan State University. RHS is responsible for the development and 
maintenance of a number of websites here at MSU, including LiveOn, EatAtState, a number of internal sites,
and many others. I have had the chance to learn how to develop web pages that
are backed up by a database, as well as designing how these web pages look. As an experienced 
student programmer, I have a good understanding of the hardware and software solutions RHS utilizes 
to keep their websites up and running.</p>

<p>
RHS uses a three-tier deployment system for the structure of their servers. There is a DEV level, 
a QA level, and a PRODUCTION level. Each level has two servers: a web server and a database 
server. The DEV level is where raw development takes place. This code is only accessible if
you attempt to access it from the RHS building. The applications here are often unfinished 
and not functional. The QA level has functional websites that are accessible from anywhere on campus.
Once a project on DEV is ready for testing, it is promoted to QA. The PRODUCTION layer is
accessible from any access point, and is kept in working order. PRODUCTION and QA are often kept
in sync, so that quick fixes and enhancements can be pushed up to PRODUCTION without the worry
of overwriting functionality that is only in PRODUCTION.</p>

<p>As previously stated, there are three levels of servers with two servers at each level. The 
web servers are Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2660 servers with a cpu speed of 2.20GHz. The servers
have Linux 2.6 (specifically, Red Hat 4.4) installed on them, along with 32 gigabytes of RAM.
To host the websites, these servers utilize Apache 2.2. The database servers are also Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2660
servers with a cpu speed of 2.20GHz. They have Linux 2.6 (specifically, Red Hat 4.4) installed on them
with 8 gigabytes of RAM. To support the databases needed, PostgreSQL 8.4 is installed on each of the database servers.</p>
